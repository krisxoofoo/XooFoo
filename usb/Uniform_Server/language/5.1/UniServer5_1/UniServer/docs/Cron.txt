 Cron
 ----

 Cron originated from a Unix environment it is a job scheduler allowing scripts
 to be run automatically at a certain time or date. Cron (chronograph) has
 become a more general term referring to a periodic tick.  

 -------------
 Portable cron
 -------------

 For a permanent installation of UniServer running as a service you can set-up
 Windows to schedule a task similar to Unix Cron check out
 http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308569 for details? This is not practical when
 running UniServer from a USB memory stick. UniServer 5-Nano resolves this
 with a small script scheduler referred to as portable cron.

 It’s fully integrated into UniServers’s control architecture allowing it to be
 run from either batch files or UniTray. To run a script or scripts a small
 amount of configuration is required as explained below.

 --------------------------- 
 Portable Cron Configuration
 ---------------------------

 Each script that requires running is added to the cron script run_cron.php
 located in folder UniServer\unicon\main

 There are three examples two for server scripts (Drupal and Moodle) and one
 for CLI script (DtDNS updater.
 Consider the three as templates allowing to to add other scripts. 

 A) Server Scripts

 These are generally single pages that require running.

 Enable a line by removing the two forward slashes. Insert a script’s full url
 (effectively this is what you would type into a browser
 to run an applications Cron script).

 The two enabled example lines as follows:

 $dummy = file("http://localhost/moodle/admin/cron.php");// Uncomment to enable
 $dummy = file("http://localhost/drupal/cron.php");      // Uncomment to enable

 The variable $dummy is just that and is never used.

 Note 1: If you have installed the above applications to different folders
         use the appropriate folder names.

 Note 2: If you have moved the servers remember to add a port number to the url.
         For example moving the servers once, Apache port becomes 81 and the
         above two lines need to change as follows:
      
 $dummy = file("http://localhost:81/moodle/admin/cron.php"); // Uncomment to enable
 $dummy = file("http://localhost:81/drupal/cron.php");       // Uncomment to enable

 B) CLI Scripts

 CLI scripts may require more than a single line to run. The DtDNS script for
 example uses two lines.

 The DtDNS automatic updater has been pre-configured and is disabled by default.
 These two lines in section List of scripts to be run

  // $cmd = 'start ..\..\usr\local\php\php-win.exe ..\..\plugins\dtdns_updater\dtdns_updater.php';
  // pclose(popen($cmd,'r'));             // Start detatched process  

 Need to be un-commented as shown below

  $cmd = 'start ..\..\usr\local\php\php-win.exe ..\..\plugins\dtdns_updater\dtdns_updater.php';
  pclose(popen($cmd,'r'));             // Start detatched process  

 First line defines a command (script) to be run. If you wish this can expanded
 into several lines depends on complexity. Last line is required to detached
 the process and must be included otherwise the Cron script is killed.

 -------------
 Periodic tick
 -------------

 Starting Cron immediately runs all scripts defined in the list. After this,
 scripts will run periodically defined by variable $cron_time currently set
 to 10 minuets.

 This is a reasonable value and should be adequate for most applications.
 Consider this to be a minimum value, ideally increase it to a higher value
 to reduce processor overhead..  

 ------------
 Running Cron
 ------------

 Start the servers and run cron from either the batch files or UniTray

  UniTray:
    Start: Left click tray icon > Advanced > click Run Portable Cron
    Stop:  Left click tray icon > Advanced > click Stop Portable Cron

  Batch files:
    Navigate to folder  UniServer\alternative_control
    Start: Double click Start_Cron.bat
    Stop: Double click Stop_Cron.bat

  Note: There can be a delay of up to one second before cron stops.

 -------------
 General Notes
 -------------

 A) Control architecture, for independent control Cron has been binary coded
    with a value of 16.

 Example of use:
  If you wish to start and stop Cron when starting and stopping both servers
  from UniTray edit file UniServer\unicon\tray_menu\UniTray1.ini

  Change these two lines from:

  Type: item; Caption: "Start UniServer (Apache MySQL)"; Action: shellexecute;
  FileName: "%PHP%\php.exe"; Parameters: " -n %ServerConMain%\start_servers.php 7";
  ShowCmd: hidden; Glyph: 9

  Type: item; Caption: "Stop  UniServer (Apache MySQL)"; Action: shellexecute;
  FileName: "%PHP%\php.exe"; Parameters: " -n %ServerConMain%\stop_servers.php 7";
  ShowCmd: hidden; Glyph: 11

  To:
  Type: item; Caption: "Start UniServer (Apache MySQL)"; Action: shellexecute;
  FileName: "%PHP%\php.exe"; Parameters: " -n %ServerConMain%\start_servers.php 23";
  ShowCmd: hidden; Glyph: 9

  Type: item; Caption: "Stop  UniServer (Apache MySQL)"; Action: shellexecute;
  FileName: "%PHP%\php.exe"; Parameters: " -n %ServerConMain%\stop_servers.php 23";
  ShowCmd: hidden; Glyph: 11

     Note: Binary 1+2+4+16 = 23  
       1  - Run Apache server 
       2  - Run MySQL  server
       4  - Start Index page
      16  - Run cron

 B) Portable Cron and Service
    Portable Cron may be run when servers are installed as a service. However
    will not restart after restarting PC, you need to manually run Portable
    Cron again.
