Note: This script must be run on a clean install of Uniform Server.

To run multi-servers on the same PC several items require changing such as
server ports, service names, Apache and UniTray executable names.

Manually changing these can be time consuming and prone to errors. The process
has been automated with the following script: move_servers.php

Run 1:
The script is run from the following batch file Run.bat located in folder:
unicon\move_servers
Double click Run.bat and enter appropriate values. 

Run 2:
Alternatively you can run the script from UniTray:
Use either the right or left menu mouse-over "Advanced" and select
"Move Servers multi-server operation"

Script:  

Unless you want to use specific ports and names accept defaults shown in
brackets by pressing enter.

Note: If you change service or Apache executable names make sure these have
eight or less characters.

The script uses existing names and either adds a digit to end of this name or
increments an exiting one. Ports are incremented, invalid ports are skipped.

When run for the first time output looks like this:

################################################################################
 Current Apache port = 80         Proposed port [81] :
 Current SSL port    = 443        Proposed port [444] :
 Current MySQL port  = 3306       Proposed port [3307] :
 Current Apache name = Apache.exe Proposed name [Apache1.exe] :
 Current MySQL name  = mysqld-opt.exe  Proposed name [mysqld-opt1.exe] :

 ===== SERVICES Service names ====

 Current Apache name = ApacheS1 Proposed name = [ApacheS2] :
 Current MySQL  name = MySQLS1  Proposed name = [MySQLS2] :


 ===== UniTray Controller  ====
 Current UniTray name = UniTray1.exe Proposed name [UniTray2.exe] :


 ===== eAccelerator  ====

 If running a single server do not disable eAccelerator.
 For multi-servers enter Y

 Disable_eAccelerator type Y or N [Y] :

 Commit type Y or N [Y] :

If you know in advance the number of additional servers that will be run
create them at the same time, just makes the task a little easier.

1) Extract a new copy of Uniform Server
2) Move the server using the above script.
3) Clone this server (copy to a new folder)
4) Move the server using the above script.
5) Repeat steps 3 to 4 for each new server.

UniTray:
Unitray's icon is updated to reflect changes (digit increments)

General Notes:

If all the servers are to be installed as a service
there is no need to disable eAccelerator.

If the servers are to be run as a standard program eAccelerator
must be disabled otherwise Apache will fail to start.

Remember to append the new port number to access server pages for example
if the server was moved to port 81 type the following into your browser:

http://localhost:81/

Important note: MySQL port

When installing third party software you may be given a choice of entering a
port number, enter the one corresponding to the moved server (you can find
this by running server status) 

If this option is not provided (generally not) then append it to the server
name e.g. localhost:3307
