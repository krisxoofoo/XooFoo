 Cron
 ----

 Cron originated from a Unix environment it is a job scheduler allowing scripts
 to be run automatically at a certain time or date. Cron (chronograph) has
 become a more general term referring to a periodic tick.  

 -------------
 Portable cron
 -------------

 For a permanent installation of UniServer running as a service you can set-up
 Windows to schedule a task similar to Unix Cron check out
 http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308569 for details? This is not practical when
 running UniServer from a USB memory stick. UniServer -Pluto resolves this
 with a small script scheduler referred to as portable cron.

 It’s fully integrated into UniServers’s control architecture allowing it to be
 run from either batch files or UniTray. To run a script or scripts a small
 amount of configuration is required as explained below.

 --------------------------- 
 Portable Cron Configuration
 ---------------------------

 Each script that requires running is added to the cron configuration file cron.ini
 located in folder UniServer\unicon\main

 You can use UniTray to open file as follows:
 Left click tray icon > Advanced server features 2 > click Edit Cron configuration

 Configuration file includes four examples two for server scripts (Drupal and 
 Moodle) and two for inbuilt CLI script (DtDNS updater and db_backup).

 Block Format: Each block has the following format

  [Unique Block Name]
  start  = 
  period = 
  path   = 
  ref    = 

 Explanation:
 [moodle] - Header a unique name enclosed in square brackets example moodle.
 start    - Time you initially want the script to start (seconds are ignored)
 period   - How often the script is to be run after the initial start
 path     - Full path and name of the script to be run
 ref      - A tracker set by Cron script effectively time to next run.
            Deleting this value allows a new start time to be set. 

 A) Server Script Example

 [drupal]
 start  = 2009-09-21 2:56:52
 period = hourly
 path   = http://localhost/drupal/cron.php
 ref = 

 Note 1: If you have installed the application to different folder
         use the appropriate folder names.

 Note 2: If you have moved the servers remember to add a port number to the url.
         For example moving the servers once, Apache port becomes 81 and the
         above line need to change as follows:

         path   = http://localhost:81/drupal/cron.php     

 B) CLI Script Example

 [dtdns]
 start  = 2009-09-21 2:56:52
 period = 600                 ; 10 Mins as required by DtDNS
 path   = ..\..\plugins\dtdns_updater\dtdns_updater.php
 ref = 

 Note 1: For portability always use relative paths as shown (..\..\)
         Path is relative to cron.ini (Note ..\ moves up one folder level)

 -------------
 Periodic tick
 -------------

 Starting Cron immediately runs all scripts defined in the configuration file.
 A new start reference (ref =) is saved to the configuration file. 
 After this, the new reference start times will be periodically checked every
 minuete.

 If the "ref" time is lessthan the current time it signals that the script is
 to be run.   

 ------------
 Running Cron
 ------------

 Start the servers and run cron from either the batch files or UniTray

  UniTray:
    Start: Left click tray icon > Advanced server features 2 > click Start Portable Cron
    Stop:  Left click tray icon > Advanced server features 2 > click Stop Portable Cron

    Note: Menu item toggles.

  Batch files:
    Navigate to folder  UniServer\alternative_control
    Start: Double click Start_Cron.bat
    Stop: Double click Stop_Cron.bat

  Note: There can be a delay of up to one second before cron stops.

 -------
 Logging
 -------

  Logging is enabled by default. Log file: UniServer\unicon\main\cron.log

  Disable enable logging edit file: UniServer\unicon\main\run_cron.php
  Change the following line as required:

  $logging   = true;  // true = Enable logging false = disable logging

 -------------
 General Notes
 -------------

 A) Control architecture, for independent control Cron has been binary coded
    with a value of 16.

 Example of use:
  If you wish to start and stop Cron when starting and stopping both servers
  from UniTray. Edit file UniServer\unicon\tray_menu_2\command_processor.php

  Find section  //== Command cmd_server_pall
  Change these two lines from:

   $cmd = "../../usr/local/php/php.exe -n ../main/start_servers.php 7"; // Cmd to run hidden
   $cmd = "../../usr/local/php/php.exe -n ../main/stop_servers.php 7";  // Cmd to run hidden

  To:

   $cmd = "../../usr/local/php/php.exe -n ../main/start_servers.php 23"; // Cmd to run hidden
   $cmd = "../../usr/local/php/php.exe -n ../main/stop_servers.php 23";  // Cmd to run hidden


     Note: Binary 1+2+4+16 = 23  
       1  - Run Apache server 
       2  - Run MySQL  server
       4  - Start Index page
      16  - Run cron

 B) Portable Cron and Service
    Portable Cron may be run when servers are installed as a service. However
    will not restart after restarting PC, you need to manually run Portable
    Cron again.
