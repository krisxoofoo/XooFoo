 To run multi-servers on the same PC several items require changing such as
 server ports, service names, Apache and UniTray executable names.

 Manually changing these can be time consuming and prone to errors. The process
 has been automated with the following script:window_move_servers.php

 -----------
 Preparation
 -----------

 Close all running servers and their corresponding UniTrays

 ---
 Run
 ---

 From UniTray:
 Advanced server features 1 > click "Move Servers multi-server operation"

 ------
 Script
 ------ 

 Unless you want to use specific ports and names accept defaults.

 The script uses existing file and service names  it either appends a digit or
 increments an exiting one. Ports are incremented, note invalid ports
 are skipped.

 When run for the first time output looks like this:

 ##############################################################################

  -- Old --       -- New --
  80              81               Apache port
  443             444              SSL port
  3306            3307             MSQL Port
  Apache.exe      Apache1.exe      Apache executable name
  mysqld-opt.exe  mysqld-opt1.exe  MySQL executable name
  ApacheS1        ApacheS2         Apache service name
  MySQLS1         MySQLS2          MySQL service name
  UniTray1.exe    UniTray2.exe     UniTray executable name
                  Disable eAccelerator checked
 ##############################################################################

 Click "RUN" button to move servers.

 Note 1:
 If running a single server do not disable eAccelerator.
 Uncheck the box.

 Note 2:
 Unitray's icon is updated to reflect prposed changes (digit incremented)

 If you have a server that uses this number press the increment button.
 Multi-servers must have unique numbers

 Note 3:
 Original UniTray will be closed and and re-run with new values. 

 -------------
 General Notes
 -------------

 1) If all the servers are to be installed as a service there is no need to
    disable eAccelerator.

 2) If the servers are to be run as a standard program eAccelerator must be
    disabled otherwise Apache will fail to start.

 3) Remember to append the new port number to access server pages for example
    if the server was moved to port 81 type the following into your browser:

      http://localhost:81/

 4) Important note: MySQL port

    When installing third party software you may be given a choice of entering
    a port number, enter the one corresponding to the moved server (you can
    find this by running server status) 

    If this option is not provided (generally not) then append it to the server
    name e.g. 127.0.0.1:3307
