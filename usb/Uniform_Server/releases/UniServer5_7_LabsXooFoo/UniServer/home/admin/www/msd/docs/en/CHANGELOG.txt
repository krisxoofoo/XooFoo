Changelog of the most important changes compared to version 1.22 (1.23 never left the beta status):

- MySQLDumper 1.24 is still working on PHP4 and PHP5
- new, light and friendly style. The "old" style is still included. 
- better use of RAM
- backup and restore via PHP is about 25 percent faster
- possibility to select tables when doing backup or restore
- use different configuration profiles to manage different MySQL-Server or -user. 
  This way you can administrate different MySQL-Server with a single MySQLDumper-Installation.
- the internal SQL-Parser has been improved (more backups from other programms can be imported)
- SQLBrowser: a lot of bugfixes and some improvements (nevertheless it must still be regarded as experimental)
- SQLBrowser: a comfortable fulltext-search lets you find text even when you don't know in which column it can occur
  After editing a record you get back to the hitlist. That is very comfortable if you need to change some data.
- Tools: in version 1.22 the export of data as file didn't work. Now it is working again.
- the Web-GUI has been simplified. Some parameters have been removed. (You nearly have no chance to configure something incorrectly :) )
- FTP-Transfer: address up to 3 ftp configurations simultaneously in one backup process
- Tables of type VIEW or MEMORY are now detected and data is not saved but the structure of the table is
- the directory work/structure is no longer needed
- the automatic "structure only" backup has been removed
- better and safer handling of encodings of backup files
- better and safer error-handling
- the backup converter has been rewritten. Now it also automatically converts big files into Multipart files.
- no notices in server-logs
- when adding SQL-Queries to the SQL-Library you can now enter more than one query. If using "command before/after backup" 
  these queries will be executed in a row. Success or failure is written into the log file. 
- When creating a password protection the password strength is visualized.

crodump.pl:
- when you can call crondump.pl in the standard directory "msd_cron" you no longer need to enter the 
  "$absolute_path_of_configdir" manually. An automatic detection was added. 
- better and safer catching of errors
- logging of events is much more precise and gives you clear information what happened
- automatic deletion now regards Multipart files as one complete backup and works the way you expect it to work
- automatic deletion is done after the backup process. In case of errors this retains your old backups you might need.
- the config parameter - which configuration profile is to be used - can be set in 3 ways. The missing suffix
  ".conf.php" will be added dynamically. 
1. config=mysqldumper.conf.php
2. config=mysqdumper.conf
3. config=mysqldumper

- removed signalhandler:
When crondump.pl was started via a cronjob there was a malfunction. On some, rare server this signalhandler caused a second 
or third instance of the script that never stopped and stuck in the process list. In this case the process must be killed manually.
