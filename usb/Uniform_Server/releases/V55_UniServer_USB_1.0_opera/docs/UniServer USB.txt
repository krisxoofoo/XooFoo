 This plugin integrates portable Opera into Uniform Server 5.5-Nano’s
 architecture. This allows Uniform Server to be run independently of the host
 PC. To achieve this it uses Portable Opera and a PAC file. (PAC file
 prevents issues with Vista and W7 "hosts" file).

 INSALL
 ------

 Options 1:

   1. Unpack a new copy of Uniform Server 5.5-Nano.
   2. Download file V55UniServer_USB_1.0.exe from Sourceforge
   3. Save it to folder UniServer.
   4. To extract files, double click on file V55UniServer_USB_1.0.exe,
      no need to change the path.
   5. New files are added to folders UniServer.
      Note: Several Uniform Server files are updated.
      Opera USB is extracted to folder apps/opera.

 Options 2:

   1. Unpack a new copy of Uniform Server 5.5-Nano.
   2. Download file V55UniServer_USB_1.0.zip from Sourceforge
   3. Save to any folder
   4. Extract files, navigate to folder V55UniServer_USB_1.0
   5. Copy its entire contents folder UniServer
   6. New files are added to folders UniServer.
      Note: Several Uniform Server files are updated.

 Run
 ---
 
 When running on a local hard drive start the servers using Start.exe or the
 batch files in folder alternative_control. This allows faster development

 The server is independent of the host PC and no longer uses a host's browser
 or "hosts" file. Instead the integrated Opera USB and PAC file are used.            

 ---------------------------
 Install on USB memory stick
 ---------------------------

 Copy the entire content of folder UniServer to the root (top-level) of a
 USB memory stick.

 The servers are automatically run when memory stick is inserted into a USB
 port, just click run at the alert pop-up.

 Manually start UniTray using either Start.exe or AutorunPro.EXE,
 close servers using UniTray.

 --------------
 Port conflicts
 --------------

 If you whish to run the servers either alongside another running server or
 if there are port conflicts run the move server script. From UniTray
 select Advanced > Move Servers multi-server operation (third menu idem)  

 Aternatively navigate to  folder UniServer\unicon\move_servers and
 run batch file Run.bat

 Note: When prompted you can enter new parameters however quickest method
       is to accept the proposed values by pressing enter at every prompt.

 -------
 UniTray
 -------

 UniTray provides convenient links to display various server web pages and
 information. In order to display server web pages Opera USB has to
 be restarted with the new page parameter. It’s a minor irritation however 
 is required to avoid Windows opening it’s default browser. Note all server 
 web pages are reflected in Apanel hence this is the only link you need to
 use from UniTray.

 --------
 PAC file
 --------

 Browsers resolve a web-address by first checking a PC’s “hosts” if unresolved
 sends a request to a DNS server. Localhost is resolved with an entry in the
 “hosts” file however some PC’s may not have this “hosts” file hence the server
 will fail. Vista and W7 security makes it difficult to update this file.

 Aadded to this for development you may be running several Apache virtual hosts 
 which require an entry in the “hosts” file.

 For a portable development server the above becomes significant hence reason
 for integrating Opera USB this has been enabled to use a PAC file.
 When a web-address requires resolving this file is checked first then the
 “hosts” file and lastly a DNS request.

 The PAC file resolves localhost and any required Apache virtual hosts thus
 avoiding the need for a local “hosts” file. The file is named my_sites.pac
 and located in folder UniServer\pac it contains this single function.

 function FindProxyForURL (url, host){
  if (shExpMatch(url,"http://localhost*")) return "PROXY 127.0.0.1:80";
  if (shExpMatch(url,"http://localhost:80*")) return "PROXY 127.0.0.1:80";
  return "";
 }

 Do not remove the lines “localhost” they are required. Below these add as
 many lines as you like one for each virtual host. For example:
 
  if (shExpMatch(url,"http://wiki.uniformserver.com/*")) return "PROXY 127.0.0.1";
  if (shExpMatch(url,"http://forum.uniformserver.com/*")) return "PROXY 127.0.0.1";

 Note: If you use Apanels's "Virtual Host Admin" enteries are automatically
        inserted into my_sites.pac file.
