Notes
-----

Note 1: Russian: UniTray is not UTF-8 Compliant hence UniTray is in English
        A viable solution has been proposed.

Note 2: UniTray does not have the capability to switch between languages this is not
        a problem; a user would select his or here prime language.

Note 3: If you install all languages Apanel and phpMyAdmin allow switching
        between installed languages.
