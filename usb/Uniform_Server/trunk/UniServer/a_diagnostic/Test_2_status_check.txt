
 This test runs a status check on the servers.
 First operation is to rewrite all absolute paths in the configuration files.

 1) Run: Batch file server_status.bat
 2) Expected result: Similar to that shown below

 ------------------- Expected result 3 --------------------------

 Your Internet IP Address = xx.xxx.x.xxx
 Accessible from Internet = NO
 Cron run status          = Not running
 PHP INI: php.ini file    = Production
 APACHE SERVER:
   Apache port            = 80  ------------- See Note 1
   Apache SSL port        = 443 ------------- See Note 1
   Apache executable name = Apache.exe
   Apache service name    = ApacheS1
   Apache SSL server      = Disabled
   Apache run status      = Not running
   Apache install status  = Free to install
 MySQL SERVER:
   MySQL port             = 3306 ------------- See Note 1
   MySQL executable name  = mysqld-opt.exe
   MySQL service name     = MySQLS1
   MySQL run status       = Not running
   MySQL install status   = Free to install
 PORT STATUS:
   Apache port     = 80 Is free to use --------- See Note 2
   Apache SSL port = 443 Is free to use -------- See Note 2
   MySQL port      = 3306 Is free to use. ------ See Note 2
 Press any key to continue . . .
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 Note 1: These values are read directly from configuration files and confirm
         CLI is running and files are readable.

 Note 2: If either of these display undefined it means Apache and or MySQL
         unexpectedly terminated.

 ---------
 Important
 ---------
 Important confirm paths have been updated (files are writable).

 Open file: UniServer\unicon\main\location_tracker.txt
 The default is: C:/Nano_5_4/UniServer
 The value should be the full path to folder UniServer
 and match your installed location.

 Now open file: UniServer\usr\local\apache2\conf\httpd.conf
 Locate this line: DocumentRoot 
 The default path is: DocumentRoot "C:/Nano_5_4/UniServer/www"
 The value should be the full path to folder www and match
 your installed location.
  
 With the above confirmed along with observation in Note 1 means files are
 readable and writeable and the control architecture is working correctly.

 Proceed to test 3
