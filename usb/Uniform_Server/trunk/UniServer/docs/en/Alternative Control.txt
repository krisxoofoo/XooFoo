 Uniform Server’s control architecture has been designed to be as flexible as
 possible. It is recognised not everyone likes tray icons but prefer batch file
 control to prevent tray icon clutter.

 Batch files found in folder UniServer\alternative_control offer this
 alternative control they can be run from that folder. If you wish can be
 copied to the server’s top folder UniServer however in order to run they
 require minor modification as explained below.

 The batch files can be tweaked to automatically close after a predefined time
 and or start UniTray. Details are provided under section Batch files and UniTray.

 -----------
 Start_2.exe
 -----------

 Before looking at batch files you will have noticed file Start_2.exe this is
 an alternative to Start.exe. Like Start.exe it starts UniTray however without
 the annoying pop-up to inform you it has done so. If you would like to use
 this file copy it to folder UniServer and optionally delete Start.exe and
 rename Start_2.exe to Start.exe choice is yours. The only reason for deleting
 and renaming is to reduce clutter and keep things consistent.

 -------------------
 Common Core Control
 -------------------

 Uniform Server has a single central control architecture located in
 folder UniServer\unicon\main all server control requests are passed to this
 core for processing. Unitray, batch files and Apanel all make requests to this
 core it has the advantage of reducing complexity of external scripts.

 -----------
 Batch files
 -----------

 Batch file control is nothing more than a single line, which calls the
 appropriate script with an optional parameter.

 The following batch files:

   Start_Server.bat
   Stop_Server.bat
   Service_Install_Run.bat
   Service_Stop_Uninstall.bat

 Can be reduced to a single control line as shown respectively:

   ..\usr\local\php\php.exe -n  ..\unicon\main\start_servers.php
   ..\usr\local\php\php.exe -n  ..\unicon\main\stop_servers.php
   ..\usr\local\php\php.exe -n  ..\unicon\main\service_install_run.php
   ..\usr\local\php\php.exe -n  ..\unicon\main\service_stop_uninstall.php

 Each line runs the PHP script interpreter “php.exe” two parameters are
 passed “-n” and the script to be run.

 –n Instructs the interpreter not use a configuration file.

 ----------------------
 Relocating batch files
 ----------------------

 After copying each batch file to folder UniServer you need to remove “..\”
 from each line. Note “..\” means move up one level from the current location.
 With the files physically moved to this location the “..\” is redundant.
 Hence the lines now look like this:

   usr\local\php\php.exe -n  unicon\main\start_servers.php
   usr\local\php\php.exe -n  unicon\main\stop_servers.php
   usr\local\php\php.exe -n  unicon\main\service_install_run.php
   usr\local\php\php.exe -n  unicon\main\service_stop_uninstall.php

 -----------------
 Script Parameters
 -----------------

 An optional parameter passed to a script provides selection of various control
 options. Defaults are used when a script is run with no parameter. A parameter
 passed to a script overrides the defaults.
 Defaults can be changed in file  UniServer\unicon\main\includes\config.inc.php
 they are binary coded as follows:

  #############################################################################
  # User Variables:
  # $server_standard - Controls server when run as a standard program 
  # $server_service  - Controls server when run as a service 
  #
  # $server_standard - Options are binary coded as follows:
  # Apache         1 - Run Apache server 0 - Do not run program
  # Mysql          2 - Run MySQL  server 0 - Do not run program
  # Index page     4 - Start Index page  0 - Do not start index page
  # MySQL Console  8 - Display console   0 - Do not display console
  #
  # $server_service  - Options are binary coded as follows:
  # Apache         1 - Run Apache as a service 0 - Do not run service
  # Mysql          2 - Run MySQL  as a service 0 - Do not run service
  # Index page     4 - Start Index page        0 - Do not start index page
  #
  # Defaults: 
  # $server_standard = 7;
  # $server_service  = 7;
  #############################################################################

 Example 1:

 If you wish to run only the Apache server when running as a standard program
 edit the batch files:

   Start_Server.bat
   Stop_Server.bat

 Change the respective lines as follows:

   usr\local\php\php.exe -n  unicon\main\start_servers.php 1
   usr\local\php\php.exe -n  unicon\main\stop_servers.php 1

 Example 2:

 Apache and MySQL servers can be run without automatically displaying the index
 page using a parameter value of 3 as shown below:
 
   usr\local\php\php.exe -n  unicon\main\start_servers.php 3
   usr\local\php\php.exe -n  unicon\main\stop_servers.php 3

 Note 1: Changing the defaults in file config.inc.php affect  Apanel, UniTray
         and batch files if they are not using parameters to override defaults.

 Batch files and UniTray:
 
 The batch files contain additional commands these have been disabled using
 “rem” (remark) removing the rem enables the command.

 For example changing “rem  Start.exe” to “Start.exe” starts UniTray when the
 batch file is run.

 When a batch file is run its window remains open until a user presses any key.
 To have the window automatically close disable the pause command using a “rem”
 Doing this you have no time to read any displayed text if you wish to read
 text enable the delay command by removing the “rem”.

 Example 3:

 This example uses UniServer\alternative_control\Start_Server.bat its current
 configuration looks like this:

   ..\usr\local\php\php.exe -n  ..\unicon\main\start_servers.php 1
   rem Start.exe
   rem ..\unicon\program\unidelay.exe 10
   pause

 Move the file to folder UniServer and edit to look like this:

   usr\local\php\php.exe -n  unicon\main\start_servers.php 3
   Start.exe
   unicon\program\unidelay.exe 10
   rem pause

 a) Only the MySQL and Apache server started (parameter 3)
 b) Start.exe - UniTray is started
 c) unicon\program\unidelay.exe 10 - A ten second delay allows text to be read
 d) rem pause - Pause is disabled hence window closes after 10 seconds

 Summary

 Uniform Server’s control architecture provides a great deal of flexibly
 allowing you to tailor the servers.
