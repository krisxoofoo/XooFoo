 Majority of domestic Internet connections are via a dynamic IP address, one
 that changes every time you connect to the Internet. This means you cannot run
 a web server unless you purchase a, static IP address from your ISP
 (Internet service provider). Even with a static IP you require and entry in a
 DNS server that converts your domain name into this IP address allowing other
 users to access your server.

 An alternative is to use a free service such as DtDNS they provide accounts
 that allow you to obtain a domain name and tracking software to automatically
 update your IP address as it changes. A big advantage of their free service
 they automatically enable Wild cards by default.

 Uniform Server supports the DtDNS service by integrating a, simple PHP scrip
 to automatically update hostname IP address at DtDNS. Script is configurable
 allowing you to update all five free hostnames. The script can optionally be
 run by cron making the whole task transparent.

  Notes 1:
   * A DtDNS account is limited to five free hostnames.
   * A hostname is concatenated with a domain name.

   * Your full URL is created from two parts as follows for example
     o If you chose "books" as hostname
     o And select from the drop down menu "effers.com" 

    Full URL will look like this:

    http://books.effers.com 

  Notes 2:
   After creating a hostname wild cards are enabled by default.
   This allows you to use a URL such as

   http://www.books.effers.com - Note www. is the wild card part this can be
                                 anything you like for example:

   * http://www.home.books.effers.com

 Auto-updater Script Configuration
 ---------------------------------

  Edit the following file:

  UniServer\plugins\dtdns_updater\dtdns.ini

  For each account you wish to update add a bock with the following format.

  [account_1]   - A uniquete name enclosed in square brackets. 
                  Can be any name you wish do not include spaces.    
  hostname =    - Full host name as configured at DtDNS
  password =    - Your DtDNS account password

  The configuration file contains examples one shown below:

  ;[account_1]
  ;hostname = books.effers.com
  ;password = fred123

  Uncomment (remove ;) to enable 
  Substitute books.effers.com with your real host and domain names,
  replace the password fred123 with the one you set in step 1)

  Uncomment blocks as required and substitute your details.
  If you need extra bocks copy an existing one making sure you change
  the block name to something unique.

 ---------------------------
 Running Auto-updater Script
 ---------------------------

 A) Manual Update

 You can run the following batch file to manually force an update,
 remember to leave around ten minuets before performing another manual update.

 Batch file: UniServer\plugins\dtdns_updater\Run_dtdns_updater.bat 

 Note: It takes around ten minutes for the DNS to propagate, additional updates
       within this period are regarded as an abuse and you may find your IP banned.

 B) Cron - Automatic update

 Cron provides a periodic tick Uniform Server's default is every ten minutes.
 DtDNS automatic updater has been pre-configured however it is disabled by default.

 To enable DtDNS edit file UniServer\unicon\main\cron.ini

 Locate the dtdns block:

  ;[dtdns]
  ;start  = 2009-09-21 2:56:52
  ;period = 600                 ; 10 Mins as required by DtDNS
  ;path   = ..\..\plugins\dtdns_updater\dtdns_updater.php
  ;ref = 

 Uncomment to enable shown below:

  [dtdns]
  start  = 2009-09-21 2:56:52
  period = 600                 ; 10 Mins as required by DtDNS
  path   = ..\..\plugins\dtdns_updater\dtdns_updater.php
  ref = 

 Optionally change the start time. If you do not change this the current time
 will be used. When Cron is initially run DtDNS will immediately run thereafter
 runs every ten minutes. Note: An update is performed only if your
 IP address has changed. 

 Note:  You need to start Cron either manually or automatically
        refer to Cron.txt page for details.

 Logging
 -------

  Logging is enabled by default. Log file: UniServer\plugins\dtdns_updater\dtdns.log

  Disable enable logging edit file: UniServer\plugins\dtdns_updater\dtdns_updater.php
  Change the following line as required:

  $logging   = true;  // true = Enable logging false = disable logging
