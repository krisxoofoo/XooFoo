The server has been pre-configured to run SSL, place any pages/site
you wish to be encrypted in the root folder “ssl”.

Uniform Server does not include a test server certificate/key pair hence a default
installation has SSL disabled. The reason is one of security a certificate/key pair
must be unique to that server after creating a new server certificate/key pair
SSL is automatically enabled in Apache's configuration file.

1) Creating a new server certificate and key.

   To create a new server certificate and key use one of the following methods:

   a) Apanel: 

   Left menu, scroll down to “Plugin Manager” and click link “Server Key & Cert Gen”
   A new page opens “Server Certificate and Key Generation” click link “Generate”.

   b) Apanel:

   Left menu, click link “Server Security” a new page opens “Security Center”.

   Scroll down to section “Server Certificate and Key (SSL)” to the right the
   link will display “Unsecure” click this link, it takes you to page “Server
   Certificate and Key Generation”
  
  c) Manually

   Navigate to folder “unicon\key_cert_gen” double click on “Run.bat”

  d) UniTray
  
  Left or right mouse click on UniTray Icon, mouse-over Advanced and select
  Server Certificate and key Generator. 

  Note 1 - common to a-d
  The certificate and key generation script will prompt for three pieces of 
  information. If you are running a local test server just press enter to
  accept the defaults.

  If you have a real domain name for example www.fred.com enter that at the CN
  (common name prompt). The remaining two prompts OU (organisation unit) and O
  (organisation) are not strictly required hence enter something that meets
  your requirements

General notes:

Note 1: Once the server certificate and key have been generated re-start the
        servers for the new configuration to be picked up by Apache.

Note 2: View secure, pages by typing https://localhost/ into your browser.
          Or if you have a real domain name
        https://www.mydomain.com/

Note 3: You can change the defaults for CN, OU and O edit file:
        unicon\key_cert_gen\ssl_gen.php

        Locate this section:

       // Get user input
       //********* Edit defaults *****************************************************

       $str1 = &prompt_user("  CN Common Name. Your full domain name ", "localhost");
       $str2 = &prompt_user("  OU Organization Unit (eg, section)  ", "Secure demo");
       $str3 = &prompt_user("  O  Organization Name (eg, company)    ", "UniServer");
       print "\n ";

       //********* Do not Edit below this line ***************************************

        If your site is accessed by typing this into a browser mydomain.net and your
        company is Fred and has asection Software the lines are as follows:

       // Get user input
       //********* Edit defaults *****************************************************

       $str1 = &prompt_user("  CN Common Name. Your full domain name ", "mydomain.net");
       $str2 = &prompt_user("  OU Organization Unit (eg, section)  ", "Fred");
       $str3 = &prompt_user("  O  Organization Name (eg, company)    ", "Software");
       print "\n ";

       //********* Do not Edit below this line ***************************************

        Create a new certificate and restart the servers.

Note 4: It is strongly recommend obtaining a signed certificate by a trusted CA check out
        Uniform Server’s Wiki for details.

        http://wiki.uniformserver.com/index.php/SSL_Part_2:_CAcert_Signing_Process

        You will require the certificate signing request this is located in folder

        unicon\key_cert_gen  file name server.csr  

Note 5: If you need to create a new key and certificate repeat the above.
