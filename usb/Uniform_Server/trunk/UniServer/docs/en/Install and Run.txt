   configuration. By default the server is locked down allowing only
   local access.

   using phpMyAdmin.

     The server default is SSL disabled. Click this link to generate a new
     server certificate and key. Once created the server is enabled for SSL
     operation. The server requires restarting for the new configuration
     to be picked-up.

    Move Servers multi-server operation -
     This menu option automatically reconfigures the servers to run on
     different ports and service names allowing multi servers to be run
     on the same PC. Extract a new version of Uniform Server and run
     the script using this menu item.    

    Perl Shebang Update cgi-bin -
     Perl scripts contain a Shebang (first line) this informs a server where
     to find the Perl program. Uniform Server is dynamic and tracks any path
     changes automatically updating the Shebang. However if the server remains
     static and you have added new scripts in the cgi-bin folder the Shebang
     is never updated. Hence run this menu item after installing new scripts.
     It updates the Shebang in all files to the current Perl location.

    small changes to this file, run menu item to quickly see any adverse 
    effects of making changes. Makes it easier to revert back to a working
    menu.
