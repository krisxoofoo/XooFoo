 To run multi-servers on the same PC several items require changing such as
 server ports, service names, Apache and UniTray executable names.

 Manually changing these can be time consuming and prone to errors. The process
 has been automated with the following script: move_servers.php

 -----------
 Preparation
 -----------

 Close all running servers and their corresponding UniTrays

 Note: This script must be run on a clean install of Uniform Server.

 -----------
 Run Options
 -----------

 There are two methods of running the script:

 Method 1:

 Run the script using the following batch file Run.bat located in folder:
 unicon\move_servers
 Double click Run.bat and enter appropriate values. 

 Method 2:

 Alternatively you can run the script from UniTray:
 Use either the right or left menu, mouse-over "Advanced" and select
 "Move Servers multi-server operation"

 Script
 ------ 

 Unless you want to use specific ports and names accept defaults shown in
 brackets by pressing enter.

 Note: If you change service or Apache executable names make sure these have
 eight or less characters.

 The script uses existing file and service names  it either appends a digit or
 increments an exiting one. Ports are incremented, note invalid ports
 are skipped.

 When run for the first time output looks like this:

 ##############################################################################
  Current Apache port = 80         Proposed port [81] :
  Current SSL port    = 443        Proposed port [444] :
  Current MySQL port  = 3306       Proposed port [3307] :
  Current Apache name = Apache.exe Proposed name [Apache1.exe] :
  Current MySQL name  = mysqld-opt.exe  Proposed name [mysqld-opt1.exe] :

  ===== SERVICES Service names ====

  Current Apache name = ApacheS1 Proposed name = [ApacheS2] :
  Current MySQL  name = MySQLS1  Proposed name = [MySQLS2] :

  ===== UniTray Controller  ====
  Current UniTray name = UniTray1.exe Proposed name [UniTray2.exe] :

  ===== eAccelerator  ====

  If running a single server do not disable eAccelerator.
  For multi-servers enter Y

  Disable_eAccelerator type Y or N [Y] :

  Commit type Y or N [Y] :

 UniTray: Unitray's icon is updated to reflect changes (digit increments)

 -----------------------
 Known number of servers
 -----------------------

 If you know in advance the number of additional servers that will be run
 create them at the same time, just makes the task a little easier.

  1) Extract a new copy of Uniform Server
  2) Move the server using the above script.
  3) Clone this server (copy to a new folder)
  4) Move the server using the above script.
  5) Repeat steps 3 to 4 for each new server.

 -------------
 General Notes
 -------------

 1) If all the servers are to be installed as a service there is no need to
    disable eAccelerator.

 2) If the servers are to be run as a standard program eAccelerator must be
    disabled otherwise Apache will fail to start.

 3) Remember to append the new port number to access server pages for example
    if the server was moved to port 81 type the following into your browser:

      http://localhost:81/

 4) Important note: MySQL port

    When installing third party software you may be given a choice of entering
    a port number, enter the one corresponding to the moved server (you can
    find this by running server status) 

    If this option is not provided (generally not) then append it to the server
    name e.g. localhost:3307
