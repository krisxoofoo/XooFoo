 Uniform Servers database backup allows for either manual or periodic backups.
 Each database is extracted from the MySQL server in SQL format and compressed
 using 7z these are then archived into a single file (7z).

 Archive files consist of a base name (changeable) with a timestamp appended.
 These are saved to folder UniServer\db_backup\archive (automatically created).

 Archive files can become large hence eat disk space. To minimise this, the
 archive folder implements a FIFO (first in first out) total number of files is
 user specified. On reaching this value the eldest file is deleted to make way
 for a new archive file.
 The above applies to both manual and automatic updates.


 -----------------------------
 Database Backup Configuration
 -----------------------------

  Edit the following file:

  UniServer\plugins\db_backup\db_backup.ini

  Default settings as shown below:

  Fifo = 6                         ; How many archive files to save. 
  Archive_name = dbs_              ; Archive name a timesramp will be added
  Excludes[] = information_schema  ; Do not remove 

  Explanation:

  Fifo = 6 This defines total number of archives to save. When limit is reached
           eldest archive is deleted to make way for a new archive. 
           Fifo stands for first in first out (deleted)  
 
 Archive_name = dbs_  This is part of an archive’s name. A timestamp is added 
                      for example: dbs_2009-09-26-18-56-32.7z

 Excludes[] = db_name If you wish to exclude databases from being backed up
                      add each one to the list with format shown. The fist in
                      this list is information_schema it is a built-in virtual
                      database which cannot be archived hence excluded                       
                      Example: To exludes databases fred123 and books.
                               List as follows:                        

                      Excludes[] = information_schema  ; Do not remove
                      Excludes[] = fred123
                      Excludes[] = books 

 Note: Fifo size is a compromise between database size, disk space and how
       often backups are required. Six was only a test value hence it needs
       changing to suit your particular requirements.

 ------------------------------
 Running Database Backup Script
 ------------------------------

 A) Manual Update

 You can run the following batch file to manually force a backup,
 Batch file: UniServer\plugins\db_backup\Run_db_backup.bat 

 B) Cron - Automatic backups

 Cron provides a periodic tick to automtically run scripts. The database backup
 script has been pre-configured in Cron however it is disabled by default.

 To enable db_backup edit file UniServer\unicon\main\cron.ini

 Locate the db_backup block:

  ;[db_backup]
  ;start  = 2009-09-21 2:56:52
  ;period = hourly
  ;path   = ..\..\plugins\db_backup\db_backup.php
  ;ref = 

 Uncomment to enable shown below:

  [db_backup]
  start  = 2009-09-21 2:56:52
  period = hourly
  path   = ..\..\plugins\db_backup\db_backup.php
  ref = 

 Optionally change the start time. If you do not change this the current time
 will be used. When Cron is initially run db_backup will immediately run
 thereafter runs every hour. You can change the period to suit your specific
 requirements. 

 Note:  You need to start Cron either manually or automatically
        refer to Cron.txt page for details.

 -------
 Logging
 -------

  Logging is enabled by default. Log file: UniServer\db_backup\db_backup.log

  Disable enable logging edit file: UniServer\plugins\db_backup\db_backup.php
  Change the following line as required:

  $logging   = true;  // true = Enable logging false = disable logging

-----------------------------
Extracting Files from Archive
-----------------------------

 Background 7z was chosen because of its impressive compression and provides a
 7-Zip Standalone Console application 7za.exe. Of real importance it is fully
 portable.

 To extract archive files you require 7-Zip Portable this can be found on
 PortableApps website  http://portableapps.com/

 Download 7-Zip Portable from the following page:
 (http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/7-zip_portable)

 The advantage of using 7-Zip Portable it allows you to view archive
 content and to extract a single database if you wish.
