 msmtp
 -----
 MSMTP is an SMTP client once configured allows PHP scripts to directly send
 emails via your SMTP mail server. This can be a local server, your ISP’s
 server or a free email provider’s server such as Gmail and Hotmail.

 Free email providers require authentication before relaying your emails via 
 their servers. Msmtp provides a transparent interface between PHP scripts and
 an smtp server, automatically performing this authentication.

 MSMTP is an open source project latest version can be downloaded
 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/msmtp/files/  

 MSMTP has been integrated into Uniform Server a small amount of configuration
 is required as explained below:

 -------------
 Configuration
 -------------

 PHP uses the default account as set in configuration file
 UniServer\msmtp\msmtprc.ini

 Before running any PHP scripts that send mail at least one account in this
 file must be configured and set as default.

 The file contains three-example configurations that will suit most
 requirements.

 ----------------------
  Configuration - MyISP
 ----------------------

 The first account, MyISP replaces the basic sendmail settings that would have
 been set in the php.ini file.

 It assumes your Internet service provider does not require you to
 authenticate. Hence all that is required is your ISP’s smtp server name and
 your email address.

   account MyISP
   host smpt.tiscali.co.uk
   from johm.doe@tiscali.co.uk
   auth off

 Substitute smpt.tiscali.co.uk with your ISP's smpt server (The one you used to
 set up your e-mail client e.g Outlook express.)

 Substitute john.doe@tiscali.co.uk with your real email address 

 To make this account the default (Bottom of configuration file))
 Change line "account default : Hotmail" to "account default : MyISP"

 Note: Other accounts are ignored. PHP will use this account to send emails and
       your ISP will relay them to the appropriate address.

 Note: This account is restrictive because it ties you to your service provider
       hence is not portable. However it has one advantage requires minimum
       of configuration.

 -----------------------
 Configuration - Hotmail
 -----------------------

 The second account, Hotmail is a free account that you need to create at the
 following address http//www.hotmail.com once signed up you will have an email
 address and password. These are required to configure your msmtp account.

   account Hotmail
   tls on
   tls_certcheck off
   host smtp.live.com
   from john.doe123@hotmail.co.uk
   auth on
   user john.doe123@hotmail.co.uk
   password fred123

 Substitute from john.doe123@hotmail.co.uk with your login email address 

 This account requires authentication hence your login details:

 Substitute user john.doe123@hotmail.co.uk with your login email address
 Substitute password fred123 with your login password 

 To make this account the default (Bottom of configuration file))
 Line "account default : Hotmail" remains unchanged

 Note: Other accounts are ignored. PHP will use this account to send emails
       and Hotmail servers will relay them to the appropriate address.

 ---------------------
 Configuration - Gmail
 ---------------------

 The third account, Gmail is a free account that you need to create at the
 following address http://mail.google.com/ once signed up you will have an
 email address and password. These are required to configure your
 msmtp account.

   account Gmail
   tls on
   port 587
   tls_certcheck off
   host smtp.gmail.com
   from john.doe777@gmail.com
   auth on
   user john.doe777@gmail.com
   password fred999

 Substitute from john.doe777@gmail.com with your login email address 

 This account requires authentication hence your login details:

 Substitute user john.doe777@gmail.com with your login email address
 Substitute password fred999 with your login password 

 To make this account the default (Bottom of configuration file))
 Change line "account default : Hotmail" to "account default : Gmail"

 Note: Other accounts are ignored. PHP will use this account to send emails
       and Gmail servers will relay them to the appropriate address.

 ------------
 General Note
 ------------

 You can create any number of accounts however make sure the account name is
 unique. PHP will use only the account you set as default.
