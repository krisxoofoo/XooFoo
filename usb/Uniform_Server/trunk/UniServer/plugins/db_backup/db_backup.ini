;# Fifo = 6 This defines total number of archives to save. When limit is
;#          reached eldest archive is deleted to make way for a new archive. 
;#          Fifo stands for first in first out (deleted)  
;# 
;# Archive_name = dbs_  This is part of an archive’s name. A timestamp is added 
;#                      for example: dbs_2009-09-26-18-56-32.7z
;#
;# Excludes[] = db_name If you wish to exclude databases from being backed up
;#                      add each one to the list with format shown.
;#           The fist in this list is information_schema it is a built-in 
;#           virtual database which cannot be archived hence excluded                       
;#           Example: To exludes databases fred123 and books. List as follows:
