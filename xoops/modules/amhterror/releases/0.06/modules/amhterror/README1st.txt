.:IMPORTANT:.
Distribution files marked "beta" (they will have "beta" in the filename!) are
still in testing and should only be used on production sites with caution.

Please see the text file docs/UPDATE.txt for more information on updating
AM HTError and if you need to run an update script. If you are installing 
AM HTError for the first time, or re-installing afresh, you need not worry 
about this.
