Translation

I have allowed for this module to be localised - or to be translated to
your local language. This basically means that all captions, text and titles
can easily be translated and displayed in your language.

The default language for the this module is English as that is my primary
language and the default for XOOPS itself. And unfortunately, while I know a
little French, I am generally useless at learning foreign languages...

If you wish to translate this module to your language, please first of all:

 1) Check to see if it's already been done (and maybe just needs updating?).
 2) Make sure you have the latest version.
 3) Consider obtaining the latest development version...
 4) Bear in mind that the files may change constantly during its development.

To translate this module to your language, go to the "languages" folder, copy 
the  folder called "english" (along with any files it contains) and rename it to 
the name of your language. Make sure that you use the English version of its 
name and, don't use capital letters and don't use any spaces.
 
Edit the files contained within your new language files  - it should (in theory)
be fairly obvious as to what you need to change.
